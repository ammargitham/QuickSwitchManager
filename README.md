# QuickSwitch Manager

In active development.

This is a GUI to change the recents provider using the QuickSwitch module. It just forwards the commands to the QuickSwitch module. If QuickSwitch is not working for you currently, this app won't help. I wrote this as an alternative to the current QuickSwitch app as the app itself is currently closed source.
